# Word-play

Using the python modules datamuse and nltk, I have created a simple python script that tells you
the most commonly preceded and the most commonly succeeded words to the given input word.

For example, if you were to input "aback", it would tell you that "aback" is directly preceded by the word "taken" 96% of the time.

I am currently searching for a word pairing that beats this 96% score!

Stopwords, such as "of, it, and" etc. are filtered out and don't count towards the score of a word.
