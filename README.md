# NLP Word-play

Using the python modules datamuse and nltk, I have created a simple python script that tells you
the most commonly preceded and the most commonly succeeded words to the given input word.

For example, if you were to input "funnily", it would tell you that "enough" is directly preceded by the word "funnily" 96% of the time.

Stopwords, such as "of, it, and" etc. are filtered out from results but do count towards the score of a word.

The top scores so far are attached.<img width="258" alt="Screenshot 2021-06-28 at 14 13 35" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57711229/123642482-3fbd0180-d81b-11eb-9708-5ccd4646f6e6.png">
